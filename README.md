# Phase Synchronizer

## Project Overview
The Phase Synchronizer is a system designed to detect, synchronize, and adjust the phase of two arbitrary signals without modifying their frequency components. This project implements phase synchronization techniques to ensure that the relative phase between signals is maintained consistently, improving stability and performance in time-dependent systems such as neural signal processing of ENG/ECG bio-signals. The goal for this project is simplicity and cost-effectiveness, allowing quick hardware integration.

## Typical considerations
Itâ€™s essential to maintain stability in the system after synchronization. Oscillations, noise, or disturbances can lead to drifting of the phase relationship, so a robust feedback mechanism may be needed to keep the signals synchronized over time.

## Key Features
- Phase Detection: Automatically identifies the phase difference between two signals.
- Phase Synchronization: Aligns the phase of the second signal with the first, ensuring phase lock.
- Phase Shift Correction: Adjusts any misaligned signals, resolving phase errors effectively.
- Frequency Integrity: Maintains the frequency of both signals during synchronization.
- Closed-loop control: Continuously monitors and corrects phase shifts to maintain stable synchronization over time.

## Tools and Technologies
- Proteus: Used for simulating and analyzing the phase synchronization process for prototyping purposes.
- KiCAD: Used for designing the main circuit and sub-circuits, as well as BoM, PCB, Schematic and Mechanical drawings.
- Arduino IDE: Used for writing basic core embedded firmware and algorithms in C/C++ for simple microcontrollers.
- Analog Adjustable Filters: A core mechanism for frequency independent phase correction.
- Digital Signal Processing (DSP): For precise phase detection and control.

## How It Works
The system works by first detecting the phase difference between two incoming signals. A control loop then generates the necessary adjustments to bring the signals into phase alignment without changing their frequency. This is particularly useful for applications like communication systems, audio processing, biomedical ENG/ECG analysis, and time-sensitive data transmission.

## Applications
Communication Systems: Maintaining signal coherence in wireless and wired transmissions.
Audio Processing: Ensuring phase-aligned audio playback from multiple sources.
Signal Processing: Synchronizing clock signals in digital electronics for better data integrity.
