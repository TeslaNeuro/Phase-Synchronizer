# Automatic-Phase-Shift-Controller

## Project Overview
The Automatic Phase Shift Controller is a system designed to detect, synchronize, and adjust the phase of two arbitrary signals without modifying their frequency components. This project implements phase synchronization techniques to ensure that the relative phase between signals is maintained consistently, improving stability and performance in time-dependent systems.

## Key Features
- Phase Detection: Automatically identifies the phase difference between two signals.
- Phase Synchronization: Aligns the phase of the second signal with the first, ensuring phase lock.
- Phase Shift Correction: Adjusts any misaligned signals, resolving phase errors effectively.
- Frequency Integrity: Maintains the frequency of both signals during synchronization.

## Tools and Technologies
- MATLAB/Simulink: Used for simulating and analyzing the phase synchronization process.
- Phase-Locked Loop (PLL): A core mechanism for automatic phase correction.
- Digital Signal Processing (DSP): For precise phase detection and control.

## How It Works
The system works by first detecting the phase difference between two incoming signals. A control loop then generates the necessary adjustments to bring the signals into phase alignment without changing their frequency. This is particularly useful for applications like communication systems, audio processing, and time-sensitive data transmission.

## Applications
Communication Systems: Maintaining signal coherence in wireless and wired transmissions.
Audio Processing: Ensuring phase-aligned audio playback from multiple sources.
Signal Processing: Synchronizing clock signals in digital electronics for better data integrity.
